# Algorithm-Assignment-3
**1. Implement Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree problem using conventional data structures for graph and test for correctness using small examples.** 

**2. We need to scale up the things - from toy problems to real life problems. For this, you need to study some large datasets provided by reputed Universities, like**

(a) SNAP - Stanford Network Analysis Project - datasets collected by Stanford University.

(b) KONECT - Koblenz Network Collection - datasets compiled by Koblenz University, Deutschland (Germany).

First study and feel the vastness of these networks from the dynamic and disjoint set operations point of view. Then try to implement graph algorithms like Connected Components and Minimum Spanning Tree using appropriate data structure for these datasets.
